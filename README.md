# p5Ktahhh
A project written for LMU CMSI 185
Loosely based on ktah project
Written and designed by Seth Cassellius
Simple avoidance game, stay alive as long as possible just for fun
Controls include: mouse, arrow keys, and WASD
About 20 hours of coding put into project thus far
Isn't the prettiest girl at the ball but has good back-end work
The theme is a simple game with a clean user interface that doesn't pretend to be a zombie game when all it has is circles for players but rather a minimalst avoidance game with clean fonts that don't distract from the game like cheesy horror fonts
